# 💫 About Me:
<br><br>Hi, I'm Ameya — a software engineer and grad student at ASU with a strong interest in DevOps, backend systems, and data infrastructure. I love building scalable systems that solve real-world problems and enjoy working at the intersection of cloud, code, and data. With hands-on experience across startups and enterprises, I thrive in environments where reliability, automation, and performance matter.

Outside of tech, I’m an avid athlete — you'll often find me swimming laps, hitting the gym, or playing cricket and badminton. 

Always curious, always learning!
